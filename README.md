#This project is being reworked. Check releases for the old codebase. 

#System for managing travel bookings and clients.

##Made summer 2016 for a small travel agency.

This project was completed before I had any formal education in webdevelopment or otherwise in programming. Only a couple of novice courses some 10 years ago and self-thought. There was no time to modernize my skills before this project as the old systems were completly manual and we needed to start getting customer data into a database asap.

###The main flaws of this system that need to be fixed:
* CSS-based design.
* Seperating the back-end and use ajax where applicable.
* PDF print formats.
* Use functions properly, also leading to a
* more modular database integration making it easier to port to different database systems.

This system has however fullfilled its purpose well and is being used daily.

I hope find the time to get the code up to a more modern standard in the future.

###Installation

There are -example files in the folders config and img.
Personalise the content of those files. Then remove the -example part of the name.
