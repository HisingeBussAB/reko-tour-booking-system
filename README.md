System for managing travel bookings and clients.

Made summer 2016 for a small travel agency.

This project was completed before I had any formal education in webdevelopment or otherwise in programming. Only a couple of novice courses some 10 years ago and self-thought. There was no time to modernize my skills before this project as the old systems were completly manual and we needed to start getting customer data into a database asap. 

This system has however fullfilled its purpose well and is being used daily.

I hope find the time to get the code up to a more modern standard in the future.
